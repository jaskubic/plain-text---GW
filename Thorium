	Nuclear energy is one of the most controversial sources of energy is use today. Despite high power outputs, current uranium reactors raise many safety and environmental concerns. Replacing uranium-based nuclear power plants with cleaner sources such as solar, hydroelectric, wind, and biofuel-based energy has been discussed. However,  these cleaner sources have relatively low energy density several orders of magnitude lower than nuclear fuel. Recently, an alternate fuel source to uranium is being considered: thorium. Using thorium as nuclear fuel has been considered before and was dismissed. Reconsidering its use requires consideration of both the advantages and disadvantages it brings. 
	
	These reactors have several advantageous characteristics compared to traditional uranium-based ones. For one, the net energy captured from thorium-232 (Th-232), the isotope used in the reaction process, is equal to if not greater than from U-235. Additionally, Th-232 is much more naturally abundant than U-235; Th-232 has near 100 percent natural occurrence in thorium deposits, and is in general three to four times more abundant than uranium (estimated enough Th-232 to last 1000 years), requiring little to no enrichment. Better fuel efficiency and increased abundance also decrease mining requirements. Furthermore, thorium-based reactors have safer operating conditions. But perhaps the biggest advantage is that thorium reactor byproducts can be recycled for more fuel. Despite the advantages however, thorium-based reactors have several drawbacks.

	For one, thorium cannot replace uranium in existing reactors. Using thorium requires either new plants to be built or significant investment in retrofitting current facilities. While cheaper than uranium reactors, thorium reactors still cost about $780 million. Retrofits would cost a similar investment, and payoff would not be seen for years. Either way, using thorium as a replacement is an expensive endeavor. Furthermore, among the byproducts of the thorium reaction process are small, but significant, amounts of U-232. U-232 is a highly radioactive and difficult to dispose of isotope. Careful handling, storage, and disposal of U-232 requires even more money in an already expensive investment. If thorium reactors are to be implemented, these concerns need to be addressed.
	
	Considering all of this, thorium reactors have distinct advantages over uranium reactors, which includes (but is not limited to) better energy efficiency, safer operating conditions, and natural abundance. Current models have important drawbacks that need to be addressed, but appear solvable. If successfully implemented, thorium will help allay nuclear energy concerns while being able to keep up with demand for the foreseeable future. In the end, thorium is a viable alternative but requires further consideration before it can be used.
