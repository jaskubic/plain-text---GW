	Nuclear energy is one of the most controversial sources of energy is use today. Despite impressive power output from nuclear reactors, there are many safety and environmental concerns with them, not to mention the history of accidents with nuclear reactors. There has been discussion about replacing uranium-based nuclear power plants (in addition to thermal plants) with cleaner sources of energy such as solar, hydroelectric, wind, and biofuel-based energy. A problem with these cleaner sources is relatively low energy density, which can be several orders of magnitude lower than coal and nuclear fuel. However, there is an alternative nuclear fuel with equal, if not greater, energy density than uranium: thorium. Despite it being initially lost to history, thorium as an alternative as resurfaced and has been shown to have several advantages and a few notable disadvantages if implemented.
	
	After world war 2, research was done on commercializing nuclear power. While many efforts focused on uranium, there were some on thorium, specifically the isotope thorium-232 (Th-232). Initial tests showed promising results, but ultimately plans for thorium-based reactors were shelved. While there are conflicting reasons as to why, the US decided to implement uranium-235 (U-235) based reactors. However, over several decades there have been major nuclear plant disasters (such as the infamous Chernobyl disaster or the more recent Fukashima-Daichii incident)  and environmental concerns regarding the mining, enrichment, and usage of U-235 in nuclear power plants. Thus, research regarding Th-232 based plants has resurfaced and garner a relatively strong interest in the past few years. And efforts to implement these plants have been made. 
	
	Thorium-based reactors have several advantageous characteristics compared to traditional uranium-based ones. The net energy captured from thorium reactors is equal to if not greater than uranium ones. Additionally, Th-232 (the actual fuel) is much more naturally abundant than U-235; Th-232 has near 100 percent occurrence when found, and thorium in general is 3 to 4 times more abundant than uranium, requiring little no enrichment and less mining. Furthermore, thorium-based reactors have safer operating conditions and produce less waste and less radioactive byproducts. Perhaps the biggest advantage is that said byproducts can be recycled for more fuel. However, there are still some concerns regarding thorium reactors.
	
	For one, thorium can't just replace uranium in existing reactors. This means whole new reactors would need to be built. And while cheaper than uranium reactors, thorium reactors still cost about $780 million. So building enough new reactors to replace old ones would be an expensive endeavor. Furthermore, the byproducts of the process produces a small amount of U-232. This is a highly radioactive and difficult to dispose of isotope, thus very dangerous. If thorium reactors are to be implemented, these concerns need to be addressed.
	
	Considering all of this, thorium reactors have distinct advantages over uranium reactors, which includes better energy efficiency, safer operating conditions, and reduced environmental impact. Combined with the availability of thorium, there is good reason to continue investigating thorium research. Current models have important drawbacks that need to be addressed, but appear solvable. If successfully implemented, thorium will help allay growing energy concerns while being able to keep up with demand for the foreseeable future. In the end, thorium is a viable alternative to current nuclear fuel sources.
